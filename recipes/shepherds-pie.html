    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an 'Americanized' version of that old standard, Shepherd's Pie. My family loves it! You can prepare your mashed potatoes as you normally would -- adding butter, milk, sour cream, whatever!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped celery</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed vegetable soup</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>3 cups mashed cooked potatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Colby longhorn cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and lightly grease a 2 quart baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, stir and cook ground beef, onion and celery until juices run clear. Drain. Pour mixture into baking dish with vegetable soup and thyme; stir well. Spread mashed potatoes on top.</li>
        <li>Bake 20 minutes. Sprinkle shredded cheese on top and bake 5 minutes more, or until cheese has melted.</li>
    </ol>
